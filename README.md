# Social Network Analysis course 2020
R scripts and Jupyter notebooks for the 2020 offering of the Social Network Analysis course taught at University of Belgrade, as a part of the [Social Sciences and Computing](https://sites.google.com/site/soscicomenglish/) master study program.

Note: If a notebook fails to open on GitHub (you get the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" ), or is incorrectly rendered, you can open it on NBViewer. Just go to the [NBViewer home page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the link to the notebook there - the rendering is even better than at GitHub; the downside is that NBViewer does not show interactive content.


Slides and other course materials are available from [this OneDrive repository](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjwXFgNk6IQbg2XpTD3GyRwNf-QK?e=4w3Pf4).
